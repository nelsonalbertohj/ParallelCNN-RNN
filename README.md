Implementation of Parallel CNN and RNN architecture for classification of motor imagery data. This project was done for [MIT's 6.s191 Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) IAP course. The project presentation is available as a pdf here [Parallel CNN-RNN](https://github.com/nelsonalbertohj/ParallelCNN-RNN/blob/main/CNN%20RNN%20Brain-Computer%20Interface%20PDF%20Presentation.pdf). The dataset used for this project was curated by Kaya et. al 2018 and made available in [FigShare](https://figshare.com/collections/A_large_electroencephalographic_motor_imagery_dataset_for_electroencephalographic_brain_computer_interfaces/3917698). This was a small-scale, month-long project, and thus only one subjects data is analyzed and no systematic hyperparameter search was performed
